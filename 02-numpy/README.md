# Numpy

Numpy is an acronym for **Numerical Python** and part of their characteristics are

- ndarray, an efficient multidimensional array providing fast array-oriented arithmetic operations and flexible broadcasting capabilities
- Mathematical functions for fast operations on entire arrays of data without having to write loops
- Tools for reading/writing array data to disk and working with memory-mapped files
- Linear algebra, random number generation, and Fourier transform capabilities
- A C API for connecting NumPy with libraries written in C, C++, or FORTRAN

One of the reasons NumPy is so important for numerical computations in Python is because it is designed for efficiency on large arrays of data

- **NumPy** internally stores data in a contiguous block of memory, independent of other built-in Python objects. NumPyâ€™s library of algorithms written in the C language can operate on this memory without any type checking or other overhead. NumPy arrays also use much less memory than built-in Python sequences.
- **NumPy** operations perform complex computations on entire arrays without the need for Python for loops, which can be slow for large sequences. NumPy is faster than regular Python code because its C-based algorithms avoid overhead present with regular interpreted Python code.
